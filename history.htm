            <p>Today, your mobile devices are thousands of times more powerful than computer systems which used to take up entire rooms of space. Networks which consisted of hundreds of miles of cables transmit information much slower than the wireless, instant message you send every day. </p>

            <p>Systems and Networks are so integral in our lives that we rarely stop to appreciate how advanced the technology has become. In actuality, the development of computer Systems and Networks amounts to over 80 years of research and breakthroughs.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">(Possibly) The First Ever Computer System</h2><center>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="history1.jpg"></center>
              <p>The first historical instance of an electronic, digital computer system was perhaps ‘Z1’ a machine finished by Konrad Zuse in 1938. It is perhaps the first complete digital system as it consisted of an input device (a keyboard of numbers), a processor (a control and arithmetical unit capable of adding and subtracting), and an output device (an annunciator that displays decimal numbers with exponents). </p><br><br>

              <h2 class="section-heading">The Showcasing of a Long-Range Network</h2><center><img class="img-fluid" src="history2.jpg"></center>

            <p>While development of computer system was rapid, and it is not long until the first long-range computer network was showcased. In 1940, mathematician George Stibitz demonstrated his “Complex Number Calculator” in a meeting of the American Mathematical Society at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. Attendees were invited to transmit problems from a teletype in New Hampshire to a computer in New York (over 200 miles north!) via telephone lines. The answer to the problems were returned over the telegraph connection only a few seconds later </p><br>
              
               <h2 class="section-heading">The Internet - a Network of Networks</h2>
              
            <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, research around computer networks doesn’t stop. A major breakthrough came with the invention of the ARPANET in 1969. It was developed in the U.S. and it interconnected four computers across four different universities; UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, Stanford, and University of Utah. Its purpose is to share resources and information among scientific users in the institutions.

Fast forward to the 1970s and the Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). But before things get too technical, let’s break things down:
</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>A <b>protocol</b> simply means a set of procedures or rules that is agreed on or standardised. Why is a protocol important? Well if two computers share the same protocols (i.e. follow the same rules), they can easily share and use each other’s data.</li>
                  <li>The <b>TCP</b> breaks down a message or file into small packets that can be easily transmitted and then reassembled. Think IKEA sending you table parts instead of a whole table. It’s just more practical and efficient!</li>
                  <li>The <b>IP</b> makes sure that these packets reach the correct destination using an address. In fact, this is exactly the “IP address” you keep hearing about when setting up your home Wi-Fi. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>TCP/IP was eventually used as a means to interconnect different networks. This breakthrough together with the ARPANET became the foundation of one of the first network of networks, which eventually became what we now know as the Internet in the 1990s</p><br>
            <h2 class="section-heading">History’s Most Important Technological Development </h2>
              <p>While it is not yet commercially used at the time, the Internet did begin to form in the 1970s. In fact, the first ever email was sent by Ray Tomlinson in 1971. However, the Internet did not become an immediate phenomenon due to a lack of connectedness of its information. Information existed in different computers in a network but there was no way of telling where, and accessing those information requires you to log on to each computers and search. Needless to say, the internet wasn’t ready for any practical or commercial use.</p>
              <p>This was until 1989, when Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, an information space which allows documents and web resources to be identified and located using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). These URLs virtually act as addresses of different web resources and data, allowing the internet to be easily navigated and information to be easily searched. Berners-Lee’s contribution revolutionized the Internet, leading to its release to the general public in 1991. Since then, this network of networks has become an unprecedented source of information, which fuels societies with knowledge, entertainment and connection.</p>
