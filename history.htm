        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Although open to debate, the first digital computer system might have been ‘Z1’, a machine finished by Konrad Zuse in 1938. It consisted of all the components of a proper system; an input device (a keyboard of numbers), a processor (a control and arithmetical unit capable of adding and subtracting), and an output device (an annunciator that displays decimal numbers with exponents) <a href="references.htm">[3]</a>.

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">In 1940, mathematician George Stibitz demonstrated his “Complex Number Calculator” in a American Mathematical Society meeting at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. Attendees were invited to transmit problems from a teletype in New Hampshire to a computer in New York (over 200 miles north!) via telephone lines. The answer to the problems were returned over the telegraph connection only a few seconds later <a href="references.htm">[4]</a>.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Universal Automatic Computer I (UNIVAC I) was the first commercial computer. It was accepted by the United States Census Bureau and was famously used to predict the outomce of the 1952 Presidental Election. Although the election was anticipated to be close, the computer correctly predicted Eisenhower's landslide victory. After decades of research and development, computer systems finally began to have a practical use for the public <a href="references.htm">[5]</a>.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a major breakthrough came with the invention of the ARPANET in 1969. The ARPANET is a network developed by the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) interconnecting four university computers with the purpose of sharing resources and information among scientific users in the institutions <a href="references.htm">[6]</a>.

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1970s</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">
The 1970s saw the development of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). But before things get too technical, let’s break things down: <br/><br/>

•	A <b>protocol</b> simply means a set of procedures or rules that is agreed on or standardised. Why is a protocol important? Well if two computers share the same protocols (i.e. follow the same rules), they can easily share and use each other’s data.<br/><br/>
            
•	The <b>TCP</b> breaks down a message or file into small packets that can be easily transmitted and then reassembled. Think IKEA sending you table <i>parts</i> instead of a whole table. It’s just more practical and efficient!<br/><br/>

•	The <b>IP</b> makes sure that these packets reach the correct destination using an address. In fact, this is exactly the “IP address” you keep hearing about when setting up your home Wi-Fi. <a href="references.htm">[7]</a>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">
TCP/IP was eventually used as a means to interconnect different networks. This breakthrough together with the ARPANET became the foundation of one of the first network of networks, which eventually became what we now know as the Internet in the 1990s <a href="references.htm">[8]</a>.Due to a lack of connectedness of its information, however, the Internet did not become an immediate phenomenon. <br /> </p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The emergence of Home Computers was perhaps the most significant technological progress in the past century. This began in 1977, with the release of three machines: <i>PET 2001</i>, <i>TRS-80</i>, and most popularly, <i>Apple II</i><a href="references.htm">[9]</a>. With an input device of the QWERTY keyboard, <i>Apple II</i> popularized word processing and spreadsheet softwares (predating Microsoft's Word and Excel!). This "Trinity" of microcomputers finally brought computer systems to the mainstream.

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1989</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, an information space where web resources are identified and located by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). URLs virtually act as addresses of different web resources allowing the internet to be easily navigated and information to be easily searched. Berners-Lee’s contribution revolutionized the Internet, leading to its release to the general public in 1991 <a href="references.htm">[10]</a>.

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">On August 6th 1991, the World Wide Web went live for the world to access. CERN announced in 1993 that the Internet was free for everyone to use and contribute to, making it arguably the greatest and most successful open-source project in history<a href="references.htm">[11]</a>. Since then, modern life has been defined by the Web.

          We've just looked into a few historical milestones in Systems and Networks, but new developments occur constantly. Today, pocket-sized smartphones are millions of times faster than 1960s-1970s computers <a href="references.htm">[12]</a>. Fiber optic technology can transfer 1 Gigabit of data in a second (that's a 2-hour long movie in about 20 seconds!)<a href="references.htm">[13]</a>. It's difficult to imagine life without our current technology; and it's only going to get harder. Fortunetely, the Systems and Networks research area isn't done developing just yet. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
